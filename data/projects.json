Its first aim is to  restore a pilot area of 500ha of indigenous lands by encouraging farmers to adopt farmer-managed natural regeneration of trees, adaptive multi paddock grazing systems, and the  planting of trees. \n\nWhile it is important that frontline communities plant trees to restore their degraded landscapes, it is also critical to engage individuals who as a result of war, climate or other forms of instability have lost their homes and livelihoods. \n\nThe project will plant 250,000 trees which will restore 500 hectare at an average density of 500 trees per hectare. This will also provide 1,000 people (at 2 people per hectare) with income, food and shelter, 70% of which are women previously affected by war and/or environmental conflicts.\n\nThe project involves displaced people affected by war and environmental conflicts and not only members of a given community because of the significant amount of climate induced migration in Northern Nigeria that is driven by climate risks and insecurity. \n\n\nwww.surgeafrica.org/jeji-restoration",

It borders with Korogwe District in thesouth and Mkinga District further east, same district of Kilimanjaro Region in the northwest and the republic of Kenya in the northeast.\r\nThis project was initially started since January 2017 as CYDO organized its members to use their own funds to prepare some few tree nurseries for reforestation to planted to the 12 the burnt natural forests in Bumbuli and Lushoto councils whereby all these district councils are located within Lushoto District\u2019s Administrative boundary. Among the 12 natural forest that are going to be planted with new indigenous trees is Magila Nature Forest Reserve, which was burnt to some of its parts due to human economic activities of making charcoal. \r\nWe have decide to ask for funding to help to facilitate reforestation process in this natural reserve forests because the burnt forest is very important to the surrounding villagers as they were able to enjoy a nice environment, get firewood and got some water for drinking, commercial and social activities were done effectively at that time before it was burnt.\r\nWe are going to plant indigenous trees known as Albizia Gummifera with its family name known as Mimosoideae and it is known as ''Mshai'' in Swahili language. This type of indigenous tree is mostly recommended to be planted within a natural forest as it conserve moisture and support water conservation and it is preferable to be planted even nearby sources of water. This Albizia Gummifera is suitable to be planted in the  altitude of 1500-1600 m with rainfall up to 1040 mm, the conditions that are similar to what is being experienced at Usambara Mountains and in Lushoto at large. Each Kilogram of Albizia Gummifera comprises of 9,000 seeds and produces about 6,750 trees per each tree nursery.The duration needed to serve for the tree nursery takes about 4-6 months to be ready for planting procedure to start.\r\n\r\nChangamoto Youth Development Organization is tax deductible in Tanzania!",

The main objectives of the GHP is i.) restoring the local Amazon Ecosystem; ii.) restoring the health of the communities; iii.) empowering communities through capacity-building and environmental education. \r\nThe Green Heart Project is carried out in the heart of the Sucumbios and Orellana provinces of the northeastern Amazon of Ecuador, where published studies suggest that the exceptionally high population of human cancer rates in the region correlate directly to environmental pollution from perilous petroleum extraction, mining, and unsustainable agriculture methods. One of the largest oil disasters in South America left behind deforestation, severe contamination, and led to displacement of Indigenous people and their health deterioration. \r\nHowever, an important community-led movement has been forming in the upper headwaters of the Ecuadorian Amazon towards environmental and social reparations as well as self-determination. \r\nSince 2006, Amisacho Restauraci\u00f3n, our local partner, has been dedicated to conservation and restoration of a jungle area isolated from the encroaching cities and deforestation practices by developing an environmental research station and training facility focused on reforestation, preservation, investigation, and education. Together with our partner, we recognize that survival of trees and environments as a whole depend on the ecological literacy and accompaniment of community members and small-holder farmers. We therefore provide not merely seedlings and a tree nursery, but grounded environmental education and capacity-building on reforestation, preservation as well as alternative methods for soil regeneration and sustainable agriculture. Together with our local partner, as well as Indigenous and local communities we will ensure that trees are maintained and monitored, therefore being able to achieve a tree survival rate of 80-90%. By caring for trees and bushes that sequester atmospheric carbon, regenerate soil ecology, provide nutrient-rich harvest, restore Amazonian habitats, we also support diverse local income streams. Amisacho Restuaraci\u00f3n collaborates with farmers \u2013 especially women farmers \u2013 schools, municipalities, as well as with the self-founded environmental committee of the Union of affected people by the severe oil contamination (UDAPT). \r\nWith the Green Heart Project, we provide necessary tools and skills to regenerate the health of the ecosystem and the local communities. High tree survival rates depend on the regeneration of soil ecology as well as the sustained participation of local communities and their long-term protection. In addition to planting trees, the planting-project also focuses on planting crops, cultivating mushrooms and creating habitats for the human population but also for wildlife and biodiversity protection. These habitats include natural buffer zones to protect streams, prevent soil erosion and filter water. LFL and Amisacho Restauraci\u00f3n \u2013 with further public and private stakeholders \u2013 are engaged in co-creating a biological corridor that acts as air filter around urban & industrial contamination areas and connects biodiversity between Amazonian animals and species that are threatened with extinction.\r\n\r\nLove for Life e.V. is tax deductible in Germany!",

        "description":"The Water Towers Conservation Network (WATONE), is an NGO in Kenya, whose goal is to conserve the five water towers in Kenya, where forest resources are sustainably developed and managed, benefiting all its inhabitants. Why?  \r\nWater Towers are the sources of most rivers in Kenya. They play a critical role in the country as they influence rainfall, provide water in ecosystems and create opportunities for investments in natural resources such as generation of hydroelectric power and preservation of biodiversity which promotes tourism. They are also important resources to the immediate communities and regions which occur primarily because they provide water for a myriad of uses. Unfortunately water towers are sensitive and ecologically fragile ecosystems that need to be protected and conserved. One of the key threats to the very existence of water towers is rapid population growth and encroachment of human settlements into these sensitive zones. The result has been severe deforestation, whose impact has been felt in the drying up of rivers, dams and springs, loss of species, reduction in agricultural production, and increased community conflicts due to competition for scarce resources,\r\nWATONE's programs and projects aim at reversing degradation of forests and tree rich landscapes by means of Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) in Key water towers in Kenya which have been severely destroyed- see government report attached. \r\nUnder this programme, we promote what the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) calls the \u2018Integrated Biodiversity, Conservation and Sustainable Natural Resource Use for Human and Economic Benefit\u2019 program in the water towers and Forest areas in Kenya.\r\nSome of the projects we are implementing include, tree planting, environmental education, solar power distribution to communities living adjacent to the water towers as well as promotion of biogas in and around schools. \r\nABOUT THE PROJECT\r\nThe project aims at raising over 10,000,000 tree seedlings which will be used to plant in Cheranganyi Water Towers/ forest ecosystem, which is among the 5 water towers in Kenya. By planting these trees, the organization will contribute to protecting soil erosion/River bank erosion/Reduce siltation and hence faciliate availability of pure quality drinking water to over 10 million people.\r\nChallenge\r\nTo achieve any successful tree planting exercise, there must be a sustainable supply of tree/fruit seedlings from the same ecological region. It is with the above observations that the Water Towers Conservation Network (WATONE) plans to establish a giant tree nursery, one within Cheranganyi Water tower, with the capacity to raise sufficient number of seedlings to be planted on both public and private lands within these two critical ecosystems.\r\nSolution/objectives\r\n\u2022\tTo raise and increase tree and fruit seedlings production within the Cheranganyi Eco system \r\n\u2022\tTo act as central and training center for upcoming tree growers\r\n\u2022\tTo reduce transportation costs of seedlings during tree planting exercise \r\n\u2022\tTo diversify tree species/type within the ecosystem\r\n\u2022\tTo act as demonstration production unit\r\nLong-Term Impact\r\nThe proposed tree and fruit nursery will produce over 10,000,000 tree seedlings annually. The seedlings will be planted in public forests/land and also distributed to farmers, NGOs and other stakeholders at a highly subsised price. The proceeds from the sales will be used to empower the communities economically.",

        "description":"Our goal on Borneo is the large-scale reforestation of degraded former rainforest areas, in a way that doesn\u2019t only save the environment and climate, but also create sustainable livelihoods for the local population. With the revitalization of deforested and degraded areas, the soil fertility of whole regions can be transformed and thus made usable again for humans, animals and plants.\r\nThe main cause of deforestation on Borneo is the global and local need for resources, like wood, palm oil and mineral resources such as gold. That\u2019s why we believe that sustainable reforestation and active environmental protection can only work if the local population also benefits economically. Only if we succeed in meeting the needs of the people with our reforested areas, we can protect the remaining primeval forests of Borneo.\r\nIn order to secure the income of the local population and protect the environment, we have developed an intelligent agroforestry concept based on three pillars:\r\n1. The planting of fast-growing trees: We use pioneer trees with high growth rates on our land, which are in demand from the timber industry at attractive market prices and are ecologically beneficial.\r\n2. The cultivation of catch crops: fruit and vegetables, peanuts, cocoa, coffee and spices between the tree rows guarantee the population a fast and constant income. \r\n3. Regenerative agriculture: Through the use of special plant species and a multitude of different plant forms, soil quality and biodiversity and thus productivity are continuously improved. The replanting stops erosion, restores water and nutrient cycles and mitigates climate change, as the growing trees absorb carbon from the air.\r\nWe support farmers with seedlings, expertise and diverse trainings and provide them with market access for their products. In order to transform the timber and food industries towards greater sustainability, we work along the entire value chain from the planting of the trees to the end consumer.\r\nSo far we have planted almost 1 Million Trees together with small holder farmers on Borneo. While working towards this first goal we have learned a lot and optimized our practices, so we are now ready for our next ambitious goal: reforest Borneo on a larger scale and plant 100 Million Trees!",

And, while we may be the oldest national conservation organization, our work today is more important than ever. Since 1990 alone, we have planted nearly 60 million trees in forest restoration projects in all 50 states. These projects recover hundreds of thousands of acres of wildlife habitat, safeguard vital watersheds, absorb millions of tons of greenhouse gases and protect some of the most stunning landscapes in America.\r\n\r\nAcross North America, millions of acres of native forests have been lost or degraded by disasters like wildfires, pests, and disease, as well as human actions like mining, development, and widespread clearing for unsustainable practices. Forest restoration can bring our native forests back \u2014 and restore all the natural benefits they provide society, including improvements to our health and well-being \u2014 while also creating green jobs at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn addition to planting millions of climate-resilient native saplings, our work includes actions like collecting seeds from the strongest \u201cmother trees\u201d to grow whitebark pine seedlings that are resistant to disease, using prescribed fire to promote oak forests, and partnering with scientists to plan restoration for the tree species and climate conditions that are expected in the future.

As a result, they have gained fertile land for growing trees.\r\nThirty years ago there was little grass in the dry rocky soil, with which the goats and sheep nourished themselves. Now a broad forest covers the slopes. It grows: pines, eucalyptus, cedros, alamos, oaks and kewi\u00f1as. The floor is now a wet carpet. It grows edible mushrooms, moss and herbs. The bare rocky earth has become one transformed little paradise. Even springs are now bubbling out of rocks. Numerous insects and birds settle down. There are eight beehives which deliver delicious honey twice a year. The climate has also become noticeably milder. There is now more rain, which also the drinking water channels for the Nearby town Sucre fills more fertile. We have: workshops and accommodation with kitchens and bathrooms for z.b. Environmental groups, Bolivian and international volunteers, school classes, families, clubs and and also for individual hikers. You will find clean air and numerous opportunities for hiking and climbing, also beautiful forest playgrounds and educational areas. For those who want to help with forest thinning, vegetable farming and small animal breeding and educational guidance of visitors are permanent tasks. In the last 30 years, the center received no public funds. The works were through donations and above all the great commitment of Bolivian and international volunteers. We are open to friendly people of all ages from all over the world!\r\n\r\nCentro Ecol\u00f3gico Juvenil (CEJ) is tax deductible in Germany!",

        "description":"Defenders of the Planet (formerly known as Rwenzori Environment Conservation Project) is a registered non-governmental and nonprofit environmental organization which was founded in the year 2005 by concerned community members who saw a need to contribute to environmental conservation due to current environmental challenges such as the issue of climate change, threatened biodiversity among others.\r\nWe raise public awareness on the relevance of environmental conservation and management, we empower communities with technical expertise and trainings on environment. We conserve and restore water catchments such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. We promote tree planting and agro forestry as well as carrying out various projects in the field of climate change.\r\n\r\nAccording to a baseline survey done in August, 2018 by DEPLA in communities living near Rwenzori Mountains National Park, the following environmental challenges were established;\r\n1.\tLow level of awareness on environmental education\r\n2.\tEncroachment on Mt. Rwenzori forest for charcoal burning and timber.\r\n3.\tExistence of Bare hills and soil erosion/ landslides\r\n\r\nOver the last few years, the forest cover in Rukoki and Buhuhira has significantly reduced. Community members reported that many parts of the sub counties had extensive forest and tree cover but now most of it is gone. This has resulted in loss of biodiversity and severe land degradation due to soil erosion and loss of fertility. The local people note that many areas which used to be very fertile are now barren and the overall agricultural productivity in the area has declined dramatically which is pushing people deeper into poverty. Moreover, pressure on the remaining forests and trees is high as the proportion of people depending on them for firewood and non-timber products is quite high. \r\n\r\nThere is high deforestation pressure for firewood, charcoal burning, brick burning among others. The community members cut trees but they don\u2019t plant new ones which have resulted in various consequences of climate change such as un reliable and inadequate rainfall, water sources drying up, over flooding and poverty due to loss of livelihoods. In addition this has put on pressure Mt. Rwenzori Forest national park which is of global importance.\r\n\r\nThe project will be implemented in Rukoki sub county and Buhuhira sub counties and will target communities who stay near Rwenzori forest.\r\nThe project will involve providing 2,000,000 tree seedlings to beneficiaries who stay near Rwenzori Forest. The trees to be planted will be agro forestry species, forestry species as well as some fruit trees.\r\nTree species to be planted will include Grevillea robusta, Maesopsis eminii, Eucalyptus grandis and Bathedavia.\r\nDefenders of the Planet (DEPLA) will raise the seedlings in nursery beds after which they will be distributed to beneficiaries when ready for transplanting.\r\nThere will be training of beneficiaries on tree planting and environment conservation which will be carried out as radio talk shows, by visiting schools and holding community trainings at our nursery beds.\r\nTrainings will be provided to all project beneficiaries on how to care and look after the trees, soil conservation trainings will also be provided to the beneficiaries. \r\nBeneficiaries will be grouped into 50 groups of 40 members per group and each group will have a leader and the project will supply tools such as 4 hoes and 4 slashers to each group to help in the trainings and care of the planted trees as well as in soil conservation measures.\r\nBefore transplanting, the project team headed by the forestry officer will register tree beneficiaries and survey their lands to identify how many trees each beneficiary need and the species suitable for the beneficiary\u2019s land.\r\nThe project will involve planting tree species that can benefit both beneficiaries and the environment at large. DEPLA will use membership fees to sustain the project and will work closely with the local leaders, beneficiaries, and sub county natural resource committee.\r\n\r\nBrief outline of project goals and benefits (eg. forest fire restoration, habitat restoration, ecological benefits): \r\n\r\nProject Goal\r\n\uf0a7\tThe overall goal of the project is to help communities around Mt. Rwenzori plant 2,000,000 trees seedlings so as to reduce pressure on Mt. Rwenzori forest which is of global importance.\r\n\uf0a7\tTo train 3600 people on forestry and soil conservation measures\r\nProject Outcomes\r\n1.\tImproved community environmental education and awareness.\r\n2.\tThe project will reduce soil erosion, increase water table, improve soil fertility and promote agro forestry in local communities. \r\n3.\tForest and tree cover (with appropriate species) promoted on slopes that are vulnerable to climate-driven increases in erosion and landslide risks.\r\n\r\nDefenders of the Planet is not tax deductible and can not issue donation receipts!",

        "description":"Deforestation of Sundarbans mangrove forest has become a grave concern for the environment because forests are vital source of biodiversity and livelihoods but are depleting at an alarming rate.  Forests are natural carbon storage systems balancing the weather and resisting the adverse impacts of natural calamities. The Bangladesh Sundarbans is one of the world largest mangrove forest ecosystem accounts 44% forests of the country and 4% of Bangladesh landscape. The Sundarbans with an area of 10000 sq. km. shared between two neighboring countries Bangladesh (62%) and India (38%) is a mangrove ecosystem. The Sundarbans is an ideal habitat for a variety of mammals, waders and seabirds and also the nesting sites for both marine turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) (Blower, 1985) and 3.5 million people depend on Sundarbans resources. The Sundarbans is a Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar site) that are also an UNESCO declared World Heritage site. Illegal forest felling, wildlife hunting, habitat degradation, climate change and good governance are causes of concern. Unsustainable harvesting of Nypa fruticans (golpatta) i.e. Cutting of central leaf, honey harvesting causes deforestation and production, fish and crab harvesting using poisonous chemical violating occupational ethics by the stakeholders hamper natural regeneration of Sundarbans resources depleting production and mangrove terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. Indiscriminate harvesting and illegal felling of tiger prawn fries from Rivers and canals dwindling the prey-predator relationship and aquatic biodiversity. High demand of shrimp larvae for shrimp farming in the Sundarbans buffer zone making the Sundarbans ecosystem degraded. There is an urgent need for forestation in the buffer zone especially the accreted land /island (char land) evolved on the River bank and is possible for plantation by NGOs/private sector thus reduce the  Sundarbans deforestation and storage carbon for future generation.\r\n\r\nThe CCEC is not tax deductible and can not issue donation receipts!",

The compensation is made through the recovery of degraded areas in the Uatum\u00e3\u2019s Reserve located in the state of Amazonas.\r\nOur planting model \u2013 called the Agroforestry System (SAF) \u2013 is a form of land use that combines tree species (fruit and/or timber) and agricultural crops: these two elements interact ecologically and complement each other, optimizing the farmer\u2019s produce, the diversification of production and the more efficient use of natural resources.\r\n\r\nThis form of work generates not only environmental but also socioeconomic benefits, since it guarantees food security and income generation for the families involved in the program, promoting socioeconomical development while reducing the pressure on deforestation for land conversion.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, in addition to being an important tool for the recovery of unproductive areas, our planting model plays an important role on climate regulation as planted trees capture carbon from the atmosphere mitigating the effects of climate change, and regulate much of the rainfall production. Moreover, Agroforestry Systems present themselves as an important strategy for local social development, as they value traditional knowledge using native species of nutritional, economic and social value to the local community, such as the car\u00e1, cassava and a\u00e7a\u00ed for food, rosewood and andiroba for the production of oils used in cosmetics, as well as species of wood use such as Ip\u00ea and Cumaru. \r\n\r\nCombining the planting of trees with sustainable production, our Project achieves: restoration, climate regulation, deforestation mitigation and socioeconomic development.\r\n\r\nThe work methodology of the PCN has already been recognized by several initiatives and is now part of the Bank of Social Technologies of Banco do Brasil Foundation (FBB).\r\n\r\nIdesam is not tax deductible",

        "description":"ENGLISH VERSION BELOW\r\n\r\nAgroforst, die Kombination aus Land-  und Forstwirtschaft, ist eine naturnahe, \u00f6kologische Landbaumethode zur Produktion von Nahrungsmitteln, welche gleichzeitig viele \u00d6kosystemfunktionen, wie z.B. die Kohlenstoffspeicherkapazit\u00e4t erh\u00f6ht. Im Agroforst stehen auf landwirtschaftlich genutzten Fl\u00e4chen neben und zwischen den Anbaukulturen langlebige B\u00e4ume und Str\u00e4ucher und tragen somit zur Restaurierung von entwaldeten Landschaften bei. Im Moment fehlt uns jedoch wichtiges Grundlagenwissen dar\u00fcber, welche Ackerkulturen und Baumarten sich am erfolgreichsten kombinieren lassen. Zudem ben\u00f6tigen wir dringend Demonstrationsfl\u00e4chen, um Bauern von dieser nachhaltigen Landnutzungsmethode zu \u00fcberzeugen. Ziel dieses Biodiversit\u00e4ts-Agrofrost-Projektes in den Anden von Bolivien ist es daher zu erforschen, welche Kombinationen von B\u00e4umen und essbaren Pflanzen am besten geeignet sind, um die Wiederherstellung des Waldes in Zeiten des Klimawandels zu erleichtern und gleichzeitig den Boden zu verbessern. Die Bodenverbesserung sorgt wiederum f\u00fcr sichere Ernteertr\u00e4ge wodurch die Abwanderung von kleinb\u00e4uerlichen Familien vermieden werden kann.   \r\nDieses Projekt ist weit mehr als ein \u00fcbliches Wiederaufforstungsprojekt, da es gleichzeitig ein Forschungsprojekt ist, dessen Ergebnisse beispielhaft f\u00fcr die Andenregion sein sollen. Die Projektdurchf\u00fchrung geschieht innerhalb einer Kooperation der Forschungsstation Mollesnejta in Bolivien (www.mollesnejta.org) und der Professur f\u00fcr Waldbau der Universit\u00e4t Freiburg im Breisgau (www.waldbau.uni-freiburg.de). Das Forschungskonzept wird es daher Studierenden erm\u00f6glichen ein Praktikum zu absolvieren und Forschung f\u00fcr ihre Abschlussarbeiten durchzuf\u00fchren. Interessierte Bauern und B\u00e4uerinnen der Andenregion in Bolivien, Ecuador und Peru werden die beispielhaften Agroforstparzellen besichtigen und daraus lernen k\u00f6nnen.\r\nDer Projektstandort befindet sich im Tal von Cochabamba, in der N\u00e4he des Tunari-Nationalparks, dessen H\u00e4nge im vergangenen Jahrhundert abgeholzt worden sind. Die dortigen kleinb\u00e4uerlichen Familien leben von der traditionellen Subsistenzlandwirtschaft auf kleinen Ackerfl\u00e4chen mit etwas Vieh. Weidedruck an den H\u00e4ngen hat zu Bergrutschen und Bodenerosion gef\u00fchrt, deshalb sind Armut und Mangelern\u00e4hrung weit verbreitet. Die Klimaver\u00e4nderungen mit Wetterextremen und langen Trockenzeiten versch\u00e4rfen das Problem der Bodenerosion und den Wassermangel derart, dass mancherorts die landwirtschaftliche Nutzung unm\u00f6glich geworden ist. Es muss dringend ein Ausweg aus dieser prek\u00e4ren Lage gefunden werden, da diese die gesamte Umwelt und die nat\u00fcrlichen Ressourcen gef\u00e4hrdet. Die Kombination von Nutzpflanzen und B\u00e4umen im Agroforst ist eine m\u00f6gliche L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr dieses Problem. Dar\u00fcber hinaus kann der Anbau im Agroforst weitere \u00d6kosystemdienstleistungen f\u00f6rdern, die in Zeiten des Klimawechsels besonders wichtig sind. In Mollesnejta wird seit mehr als 20 Jahren mit Agroforst experimentiert und die Ergebnisse \u00fcber NGOs mit Kleinb\u00e4uerinnen und Kleinbauern in der Region umgesetzt. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Anwendung von Agroforst die lokale Biodiversit\u00e4t sogar an \u00f6kologisch sehr verarmten Standorten wiederaufleben l\u00e4sst, und die Bodenfruchtbarkeit und \u2013wasserspeicherf\u00e4higkeit signifikant verbessert. Zudem k\u00f6nnen kleinb\u00e4uerliche Familien durch Anbau im Agroforst auf ehemals stark ausged\u00f6rrten Fl\u00e4chen viele Produkte ohne den Einsatz von Agrochemie ernten. \r\nBislang stammen diese Ergebnisse von kleinen Parzellen und es noch nicht klar, welche Kombination von B\u00e4umen und essbaren Pflanzen geeignet sind, um eine Ausweitung der Agroforstwirtschaft auf gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fl\u00e4chen, die von mittelgro\u00dfen Bauern bewirtschaftet werden, zu f\u00f6rdern. F\u00fcr den Erhalt des \u00d6kosystems der andinen T\u00e4ler ist eine z\u00fcgige Ausweitung der agroforstlich produzierenden Fl\u00e4chen jedoch wichtig, damit die Zerst\u00f6rung der letzten Land- und Wasserressourcen gestoppt werden kann. Aufgrund der bisherigen Ergebnisse sollen im Projekt heimische Baumarten und von der lokalen Bev\u00f6lkerung erw\u00fcnschte Obstgeh\u00f6lze (Dattelpalme, Apfelbaum, Feige) zusammen mit der traditionellen Fruchtfolge von Ackerkulturen (Mais, Bohnen, Kartoffeln) kombiniert werden. Im Rahmen einer l\u00e4ngerfristigen angelegten Untersuchung soll erforscht werden, welche Artenkombinationen besonders vielversprechend f\u00fcr die Erbringung von diversen \u00d6kosystemdienstleistungen sind. Die Projektergebnisse werden modellhaft f\u00fcr die ganze Region und sogar auf andere L\u00e4ndern mit \u00e4hnlichen Umweltproblemen \u00fcbertragbar sein. Da dieses Waldrestaurierungs-Projekt gleichzeitig ein wissenschaftliches Forschungsprojekt ist, m\u00fcssen strenge wissenschaftliche Auflagen eingehalten werden, deshalb sind die Kosten je Baum mit 6,50 -\u20ac h\u00f6her als in reinen Wiederaufforstungsprojekten. Besonders wichtig ist, dass jeder Baumsetzling unter den gleichen Bedingungen gepflanzt und gepflegt wird, damit die Ergebnisse der verschiedenen Artenkombinationen vergleichbar sind. Dazu muss das Pflanzsubstrat mit Kompost aufgewertet und das \u00dcberleben der Setzlinge zu Beginn durch k\u00fcnstliche Bew\u00e4sserung garantiert werden \u2013 denn jeder einzelne Setzling ist f\u00fcr das Gesamtergebnis wichtig.\r\nMollesnejta, mit langer Erfahrung und breitem Wissen im Bereich Agroforst, wird die Projektleitung vor Ort innehalten, und sich um die Pflanzvorbereitungen, das Auspflanzen und die Pflege der Agroforstparzellen k\u00fcmmern. Die Professur f\u00fcr Waldbau der Universit\u00e4t Freiburg im Breisgau wird f\u00fcr die wissenschaftliche Beratung und Unterst\u00fctzung bei der Projektdurchf\u00fchrung sowie f\u00fcr die Datenaufnahme und die Datenanalyse verantwortlich sein. Beide Partner verfolgen das Ziel eines Forschungsprojektes, in welchem die Effekte der Diversit\u00e4t auf \u00d6kosystemdienstleistungen im Agroforst wissenschaftlich ermittelt werden sollen.\r\n\r\nAgroforestry is one way to increase carbon stocks in the landscape while also providing local people with some immediate benefits from harvesting of crop plants. This increases the incentives for enriching the land with long-lived plants. Yet, in many situations, we still need to find out, which types of trees and agricultural crop plants can be best combined. In addition, demonstration sites are needed to convince farmers of such new land-use approaches. The aim of this project is to establish an agroforestry-biodiversity experiment to identify which combination of trees and edible plants are best suited to facilitate forest restoration while at the same time meliorating the soil in order to ensure its productivity in times of climate change to avoid migration of local farmers. \r\nThis project goes beyond the goals of a normal restoration planting because it is also a research experiment that is designed to facilitate transfer of our results to a much larger spatial scale compared to the planted area itself. This project will be carried out in cooperation between Mollesnejta and the Chair  of Silviculture at the University of Freiburg in Germany - http://www.waldbau.uni-freiburg.de/. Thus the experimental planting will also have the additional benefit of training university students.\r\nThe location of the project is on the property of the Mollesnejta research farm in a semiarid Valley of the Bolivian Andes, located nearby the Tunari National Park, which was completely deforested in the 1960s.  The farmers in the Park live on subsistence agriculture. They keep cattle and cultivate crops with traditional farming methods but the yields are low. Malnutrition and poverty are widespread. Reasons for the low yields are that deforestation and overgrazing in the past has caused extreme soil erosion and landslides. In addition, intensive agriculture and the increasing exposure to extreme weather events due to global warming make farming almost impossible in some locations. All these factors put this unique environment and all the people who depend on it in an extremely precarious situation, and there is an urgent need to find approaches to counteract this environmental crisis.\r\nAgroforestry, the combination of trees and crops in the same area, is an effective solution to this problem because this type of land-use can provide many ecosystem services. Therefore, agroforestry is considered a promising tool for restoring landscapes in face of climate change. For more than 20 years, experiments with agroforestry have been carried out in Mollesnejta and the experiences have been passed on to NGOs and small farmers from the regions. Previous results from Mollesnejta show clearly substantial benefits for native biodiversity and that even on extremely degraded sites, the conditions of the soil have improved considerably when managing the land through agroforestry. As a result of this, agroforestry allows farmers to achieve sustainable production and hence higher income on formerly degraded sites. Yet these results are based on experimental plots of relatively small size and so far it is not clear which combination of trees and edible plants are most promising. Therefore, this project is designed in way that will allow us to scale-up the results to make them most useful for farmers. To this end, we will plant native trees and other edible crop species (Date Palms, Apples, Indian Figs) that are preferred by the local community and by assembling species in a way that allows us to assess the benefits of biodiversity on ecosystem services generated by our agroforestry systems. With this project we aim to become a model for the entire region or even for other regions with similar environmental problems. \r\nBecause our restoration project is also a scientific experiment, which requires several strict preconditions to be met, the costs for planting one tree amounts to 6.5, - \u20ac: Most importantly, we need to make sure that the planted seedlings grow under comparable conditions (think of it as us trying to get a bit closer to the proper experimental conditions that one would get only in a greenhouse). Therefore, all planting stock must be of high quality, the soil has to be prepared in a homogenous way so that each tree has the same starting condition as its neighbor. In addition, in the first year we have to use organic compost as a fertilizer and irrigation to ensure the survival of our seedlings because they are needed for the experiment. \r\nDue to their established experience with agroforestry systems in the region, Mollesnejta will be responsible for the actual management of this project including all planting, site preparation and maintenance activities. The partner from the University of Freiburg will be responsible for scientific advice and assistance regarding establishment and management of trials as well as the analyses of data from this project. Both partners pursue the objective that over time this project will become a site where research projects can be carried out under the umbrella of analyzing effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning in agroforestry.",

Lushoto is a district with a very conducive environment to support growth of trees especially fruit trees. As being among the local government, among of its schools both secondary schools and primary schools students do not get food at school due to poor income of their parents; a situation that leads to truants behavior and poor performance of these students and pupils while at school due to hunger. We need to plant 15,000 fruit trees just to start with that will be planted to the government schools,  and public roads so that we can keep the community  out of hunger  and be free from diseases which can be treated by eating fruits. It will also include planting 7,000 fruit trees from Mombo road to Lushoto that is 32 kilometers long. \r\nThe 8,000 fruit trees will be planted within Secondary and Primary school grounds with the aim of increasing shades, food and conserve the general environment at schools and along the road from Mombo to Lushoto that takes 45 minutes drive by bus from Mombo to Lushoto. All the land  are owned by the government and the consent is there for this project to be conducted. Due to the fact that some people live in extreme poverty and have no bus fare to pay and travel from Mombo to Lushoto, they tend to travel by walking with the bare foot while with nothing to eat on the way even most of them,do travel with luggage on their heads but with hunger. This project will green the road from Mombo to Lushoto town, increase shade as well as food  from the fruits that will be obtained by these poor individuals to feed themselves while walking.",

        "description":"Rural population of Uganda depends on natural forest resources for basic subsistence needs for example, over 99% of the national energy demand is met from wood fuels. Large volumes of poles and timber are also used for construction, furniture making and other manufactures. \r\nCharacteristically, the productivity of Uganda\u2019s natural forests is low and has all along been known to be unable to satisfy demand of the population. Hence a deliberate policy of tree planting was promulgated way back in the 1940s. \r\nThe tree planting project will be carried out in vulnerable and natural resource-constrained communities of Rukoki sub-county, Bulembia Division, and Nyakabingo parish in Kasese district, Uganda. Various tree species are proposed to be planted and among others are fruit trees and agro forestry trees while some are proposed to be put on bare hills like pine, spruce, cedar, and many other native tree species where crops cannot be nurtured. The proposed tree species to be planted in the proposed geographical area shall be over 1000000 trees of different tree species either nurtured by local communities from nursery beds or bought from external sources with the theme of GREENING AND CONSERVING FOR THE FUTURE \r\nThe project shall majorly be implemented in 5 vulnerable communities of Nyakabingo, Bulembia, Kabughabugha, Kibolhu and Kibonderya and is to benefit over 300 households from each village thus targeting 1500 households all together involving five (5) school communities and five (5) church communities from the above communities mainly focusing on greening and restoring at least 40% of the degraded bare hills adjacent to mount Rwenzori National Park that are associated with serious soil erosion, landslides, drought and other local areas that have mainly been affected with climate change effects\r\nIn here, 4 to 6 woodlots are projected to be the initial long term output with other associated ecological benefits. The objective of the project is to increase tree cover in vulnerable and resource-constrained communities due to climate change and this will help rural communities drive towards achieving two sustainable development goals (SDGs) No.13 and No. 15, thus to say *taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts* and protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests and combat desertification.\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=217568665390022\r\nRwenzori Rural Health Services is not tax deductible and can not issue donation receipts!",

The ultimate goal is to conserve the habitat of the last wild orangutan populations living in these most species-rich ecosystems of our plant. \r\n\r\nThroughout the last decades, 80% of Borneo\u2019s rainforests have been destroyed by logging, agricultural cultivation (mostly palm oil plantations), peat and forest fires, mining, as well as urban settlements. Orangutans have lost more than 60 percent of their habitat within the last 20 to 30 years. Today, they belong to the most critically endangered species in the world.\r\n\r\nThe SOS Borneo Project is located in one of the most threatened areas on the island of Borneo: The Mawas conservation forest, which is about twice the size of London. \r\n\r\nHistorical Background \r\n\r\nDuring the 1990s, Indonesia aimed to fight widespread hunger by establishing a self-sufficient rice production. For that purpose, about 1 million hectares of peat forest were designated for rice cultivation and destroyed. In Borneo alone, 4.000 km of drainage canals were created to allow for this agricultural production. The plan did not succeed and the rice project has since been abandoned. \r\n\r\nThe Mawas rainforest in Central-Kalimantan was and is amongst the most heavily affected and degraded areas. Since 2003, BOS Foundation in Indonesia has been responsible for protecting and restoring the wildlife there. This is critical because the Mawas conservation forest is home to more than 2.500 wild orangutans - one of the largest known wild orangutan populations in the world. In 2013, Mawas has been declared an area of high conservation value. However, illegal logging, pouching as well as wild fires continue to threaten the precious wildlife and its habitat. The drainage canals facilitate these illegal activities: They are frequently used to enter the conservation area and transport the illegally cut wood and bush meat. \r\n  \r\nCanal Blocking & Reforestation\r\n\r\nEspecially in 2015 and 2019, large areas have been destroyed by peat and forest fires. Because peat forests store up to 20 times more carbon than non-peat mineral soils, such fires as well as the drying-out of the peat swamps themselves have a devastating climate effect. Until today, huge areas in Mawas remain degraded.\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, BOS plans to restore and replant approximately 70.000 hectares with more than 1 million trees. The first milestone, however, shall be a 1.000 hectares large area called Rantau Upak (in southern Mawas). Between 2016 when BOS Schweiz started to financially support this initiative until the end of 2019, 162.323 seedlings have been produced in own tree-nurseries and 144.4 hectares of rainforest have been replanted. Beforehand, 38 drainage canals (with an overall length of more than 60 km) were blocked to re-wet the soil, re-establish its natural fire protection and cut the illegal activities. \r\n \r\nThe collection of seeds, the creation of tree nurseries, the production and planting of seedlings as well as the blocking of drainage canals is implemented by the local communities themselves with support from the BOS Mawas team. Thus, village groups are responsible for replanting and restoring those large peat forest areas.\r\n\r\nPeat Fire Patrols & Alternative Livelihoods\r\n\r\nDespite restoration and reforestation activities, the SOS Borneo Project closely works with the local communities and with regional institutions to combat illegal activities as well as peat and forest fires in this area. Measures taken include enhanced law-enforcement, education and the creation of alternative, i.e. legal and sustainable, sources of income through a micro-credit system.\r\n\r\nForest and peat fires pose a major threat to the rainforest and are a recurring annual phenomenon in this region. Local communities and other concession holders use slash-and-burn techniques to prepare their land for the upcoming planting season. The fire gets out of control and in some cases is burning for months (above and underneath the surface). The SOS Borneo Project supports the organisation of volunteer fire patrols among the villages, equips them and supports the establishment of wells.\r\n\r\nSOS Borneo is far more than an orangutan conservation project: It combines the conservation of biodiversity in general with forest conservation, climate protection and community development. Please support this holistic approach! We, the orangutans and people in the Mawas area urgently need your financial support!",

        "description":"The Campaign ReNordestando - Together for the Restoration of Brazilian Northeastern Ecosystems will contribute to the planting of 200 thousand native seedlings in the Atlantic forest and Caatinga biomes starting from 2019. This campaign brings together forest conservation and forest restoration, activities performed by CEPAN during its 19 years of activity. With a daring goal, the ReNordestando campaign will set in motion socio-economic chains of forest restoration, engaging various social sectors within the two biomes.\r\nThe idea of creating such a campaign sparked from the critical conditions of the Northeastern ecosystems, that are severely degraded. While the Atlantic Forest (rainforest) reached the biodiversity hotspot status due to the scarcity of remnants and high endemism of species, the Caatinga biome (dry forest) is being highly threatened by fires, illegal logging and growing desertification processes in the entire region. Although there is a misconception that Caatinga is a biodiversity-poor biome, the remnants are shelters for several endemic species and they provide important environmental services for the population in different scales, from local to regional and even national levels. On the other hand, even though both biomes are under harsh conditions and there is a high restoration debt to be achieved, restoration activities and the productive chain are poorly developed, which means that such activities and the importance of forests for the population (and for the biodiversity on its own) are generally overlooked.\r\nGiven that CEPAN main focus is to conserve and restore Northeastern ecosystems while increasing socio-economic opportunities, the ReNordestando Campaign was launched to create new demands of forest restoration within the biomes, restoring priority areas for biodiversity and ES increase while safeguarding food, water, and energy safety. In parallel, to meet the demands of executive activities of restoration, local populations are also included and benefited within the productive chain, through the active purchase of native seed and seedlings from collectors and nurseries and hiring local people for performing field activities, which involves the costs of tree planting (seed and/or seedling acquisition, field preparation, executive activities and maintenance activities).\r\nSites are selected based on the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM), created by IUCN and World Resources Institute (WRI), and applied to Caatinga and Atlantic Forest biomes as a tool for prioritizing restoration areas that boost biodiversity and ES while maximizing food, energy, and water security, in a way that can potentialize the positive effects expected in the ecological, economic and social sectors. On a side note, within these areas, there is a focus on planting in schemes that may potentialize the ecosystem services, as the Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs) that appear in the Brazilian Forest Code.\r\nOnce the donations made by individuals and companies are made available, the sites are selected and the technical team visits the area in order to design the restoration scheme that best suits the area, which can be a mix of total planting, direct seeding, enrichment, nucleation, agroforestry, and many others, enhancing the potentials of each area for intervention. Forest inputs are mainly obtained from local producers, as a manner to move the local economy. The Campaign is also open to landowners interested in receiving planting activities within private sites, which are analyzed and integrated into our database.\r\nThis project is a CEPAN wish to promote social, economic and environmental change to neglected areas within the Northeast of Brazil while creating new networks with institutions and individuals from all sectors towards a sustainable, thriving future.\r\n\r\nCEPAN is not tax deductible and cannot issue donation receipts!",

Therefore, we start from the top of the mountain with countermeasures. On 3007-meter-hight, the Arba Minch University (AMU) has got 24.6 hectares which have been deforested by the local villagers leading to depletion of humus through erosion. Now, as part of the solution a meadow orchard and an agroforest shall be planted on at least half of this area. In total 17,000 trees will help to stop the loss of humus, while absorbing a part of the overmuch CO2 out of the atmosphere (more precisely absorbing the carbon (C) and giving back the oxygen (O2)). In the orchard and agroforest, we will plant trees like apple, pear, plum and chestnut trees. Below those trees partial shade trees and lower plants like vegetables will be planted for symbiosis. With this agroforestry and permaculture concept, we also introduce Terra Preta with several benefits. It will give long lasting fertilization to the soil and will increase the growth of plants. The preserved and improved humus will capture additional CO2 and will store water, which raises the level of the ground water as well. This overall approach, will help the resilience of these trees, create biodiversity and diverse nutrition. Planting, maintaining and later sales of surplus fruits and vegetables will create long-term income for the villagers. The villagers will be trained to train others to become multipliers for this high impact approach with great leverage effect.\r\n\r\nIn the name of todays and future children, thank you very much for your support!\r\n\r\nThis project is TAX deductible in Germany.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\nAMU EcoVillage Project develops a sustainable high-quality lifestyle for rural regions in Africa. \r\nIt aims to build a small prototype village with modern buildings from natural materials with renewable energy, resources-oriented wastewater systems for fertilizer and soil substrate production, self-sustained and sustainable surplus farming capabilities, a preventive healthcare center, a project-based learning environment for local villagers and students, and of course to provide internet access.\r\nAdditionally, it shall act as incubator and accelerator for green inclusive business start-ups. A sustainable forestry is only the start.  \r\nIn short it supports 16 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the United Nations (UN). \r\n \r\nContact: project@unavision.eu",

        "description":"STRENGTHENING WOMEN TO PLANT FRUIT TREES FOR SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOOD\r\nThe livelihoods of NYAKABINGO and KABUGHABUGHA communities are deeply dependent on farming and other land use, which provide incomes and food. According to our needs assessment 65% of these community residents are mostly small land holdings of between1-5 acres or less. Fruits for sustainable Livelihoods will work for vulnerable families who are most at risk from poverty and malnutrition.\r\nPlanting fruit trees is a popular way that local farmers can improve the productivity of their land. Through this project, we plan to establish two tree nurseries and train participants to graft and handle their own high-quality fruit trees. These can then be sold for a profit or planted to enhance their own farms. The project will focus on various fruit crops like mango, avocado, jackfruit, citrus, orange and paw paw which have high nutritional value and sell for a good price in local markets.\r\nBy helping farmers plant fruit trees on their land, we are helping farmers get alternative sources of income mostly marketing fruits thus reducing their reliance on natural forests, protecting them from overexploitation combined with the advantages of agroforestry; this is a positive step for both people and ecosystems living around Mt Rwenzori Forest National Park.\r\nWHY BUILD A NURSERY BED\r\nA nursery bed in the community will assume stewardship or ownership to the community we are serving. This will attract more community members to get involved in the tree-planting project because they will assume a sense of belonging to the project.\r\nProducing seedlings is in the long-term cheaper and so cost effective than buying seedlings from other nursery beds \u2013 the main challenge so far. By training community members skills and knowledge will be gained e.g. to build an own nursery bed. The community will be much involved in all stages of the project and create employment opportunities like the full time nursery bed attendant and this will stimulate a sense of belonging to inspire most community members to join\r\nIn future it is planned to re -green and restore the degraded landscapes of NYAKABINGO AND KABUGHABUGHA rural communities that are severely affected by Climate Change. In this project, we will plant 500,000 fruit trees until 2030 that is when availed with necessary resources to establish a large tree nursery. Currently we start with a nursery bed costing USD $4.564 for which we request climate change champions to help us mobilize and channel to this project in Uganda, East Africa.",

Through our tree-planting program, we plant native trees in priority areas in need of reforestation as a result of natural disturbance, i.e. wildfire (80%), landslides, hurricanes, wind storms. Over one million acres of our National Forests are in need of reforestation. Our goal is to have all projects completed by 2025.\r\nWe work with the U.S. Forest Service to plant trees. Trees we plant are sourced from six Forest Service tree nurseries where native tree seedlings are grown for planting on National Forests.

Importantly we reconnect people (especially those in urban areas) with nature, and inspire a love and respect of the natural environment. \r\n\r\nIn Western Australia the botanical diversity is incredibly high. Botanically it is in the top 10 most diverse places on the planet. But it is threatened by land clearing for agriculture, housing and recreation that can bring weed invasions, animal road deaths, habitat destruction, species extinction and climate change.\r\n\r\nThe cost per tree: \u20ac3.1 is comprised of the following:\r\n\r\nPre-Planting Activities\r\n- Land acquisition/negotiation with landholder,\r\n- Site preparation including weed & pest control, species selection, reticulation installation.\r\n- Preparation of planting event which includes up to 160 volunteers\r\n\r\nPlanting Day\r\n- Setting up at the planting site \r\n- Induction of volunteers for Occupational Safety & Health\r\n- Training volunteers in planting procedures\r\n- Catering\r\n- Quality control of planting\r\n- Packing up the tree planting activity\r\n\r\nPost Planting Activities\r\n- monitoring and maintaining the site for 3 years.",

Its natural vegetation composes of a mixture of a tropical mountain rainforest, tropical dry forest and tropical cloud forest. This requires and \u2013 at the same time \u2013 allows for a great biodiversity and it actually is located in one of the world\u2019s most precious biodiversity hotspots!\r\n\r\nTo restore the natural ecosystem we need to work the ground before starting to plant trees. We will use water retention landscaping (also called \u201crainwater harvesting\u201d) to raise the groundwater table, to prevent further erosion and to regenerate and revive the barren soil. As the mountain slope is pretty steep, these structures have to be implemented by hand \u2013 the use of heavy machines is not possible. Therefore, the cost-per-tree might be comparably high. However, it does make a lot of sense to restore natural ecosystems on steep mountainsides that are not productive and not very useful for agriculture. In fact, we should mostly reserve highly productive plane landscapes for agricultural uses and focus on less productive lands for reforestions!\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Mountain \u2013 natural Reforestation is a well-planned thoughtful ecosystem restoration project combining the protection of threatened biodiversity and the mitigation of climate change. It serves as a wildlife reserve that helps to connect highly diverse National parks and stores great amounts of CO2 at the same time!\r\n\r\nWith your help we can make it become reality!\r\nThank you very much for your donation! <3",

        "description":"The Indonesian rainforests are amongst the most biodiverse in the world, they provide oxygen for us and regulate our global climate. Nevertheless, 1.3 million hectares of rainforest are destroyed every year in Borneo alone. This is one of the highest deforestation rates worldwide. Day after day, the livelihood of orangutans and other critically endangered species is dwindling to satisfy our growing hunger for tropical wood, palm oil or coal. Oftentimes, forest is slashed and burned, resulting in annual forest and peat fires that accelerate climate change and endanger the health of millions of people.\n\nAs part of the One-Tree-One-Life Campaign, BOS Schweiz is supporting the reforestation of burned rainforest areas in East-Kalimantan, Indonesia. The tree-planting (fruit and timber trees, all endemic and mostly endangered species) happens on BOS Foundation\u2019s land (in and around BOS Foundation\u2019s orangutan rescue and rehabilitation center in Samboja Lestari). All reforestation activities there are carried out by BOS Schweiz and other volunteers as well as the local employees of BOS Foundation.\n\nPlease help us with this effort by donating trees for CHF 7.65 each (seedling + 5 years of care). Join in and experience how your commitment takes root on the island of Borneo, Indonesia!\n\nIn the past 20 years, the orangutans have lost 55 percent of their natural habitat. Wild populations have therefore shrunk by more than 80 percent in the past 20 to 30 years. But it's not just biodiversity that is under threat. More than 900'000 hectares of forest and land burned across Indonesia in summer 2019 alone. 44 percent of these were valuable peat forests. They store millions of tons of carbon and - if they are put on fire - emit four to 40 times more CO2 than forest fires in other tropical areas. For this reason, the World Bank estimates that peat and forest fires in Indonesia emitted almost twice as much CO2 into the atmosphere in 2019 than the simultaneous fires in the Amazonas area!\n\nPeat and forest fires are an annual phenomenon in Indonesia. The 1997 fires were particularly bad. At that time, 1.5 million hectares of peat forests in southern Borneo burned, producing 13 to 40 percent of the world's greenhouse gases in that year. 8000 Borneo orangutans died. In autumn 2015, very severe fires happened as well burning uninterruptly for months. In an area half the size of Switzerland, 127'000 fires blazed and smoldered. They released 16 million tons of CO2 per day - more than the entire US produced at the same time. Again thousands of orangutans died in the flames and BOS experienced a massive influx of orangutans into its rescue and rehabilitation centers.\n\nIn 2015, 300 hectares of rainforest around the BOS rescue and rehabilitation center in Samboja Lestari also fell victim to the flames. Today, BOS is reforesting this area together with volunteers and employees of BOS Foundation and as part of the One Tree One Life campaign. The size of the ex-burned area not yet planted is 218.72 hectares.\n\nThe seedlings are grown in an own tree nursery. A mix of fruit and timber trees are planted - all endemic and mostly endangered species. \n\nIn fact, the entire 1800-hectare area of Samboja Lestari has be replanted, tree by tree, because at the current location of the rescue center almost 20 years ago there was only degraded grassland. The reforestation work was largely completed in 2010 and almost the entire destroyed area was covered with a functioning rainforest when in 2015 (and also in 2019) the fire returned.  \n\nThe Samboja Lestari forest is not home to a wild orangutan population. In Samboja Lestari, BOS uses the forest for its rehabilitation and pre-release activities: Over many years, traumatized, injured and orphaned orangutans are prepared for a release there. In addition, unreleasable orangutans (and over 70 rescued and unreleasable sun bears) find shelter in Samboja Lestari on natural or man-made islands or huge forest enclosures. \n\nSo far, many of the original animal species have returned to the replanted rainforest. Today, Samboja Lestari is one of the last green islands in the region that needs to be preserved.  \n\nSince December 2017, the aim of the One-Tree-One-Life campaign has been to raise money for seedlings/trees planted accross our reforestation projects in East-Kalimantan (Samboja Lestari) and two additional reforestation projects in Central-Kalimantan (both present on this platform as well). Each year, the One-Tree-One-Life campaign enters into a new round of fundraising and comes with another volunteer trip organized by BOS Schweiz.

KardiaNuts intends to achieve this vision through the development of a cashew-based agroforestry system that will generate inclusive and sustainable growth in an isolated region in Colombia. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses development and environmental challenges in Vichada, Colombia. The population is one of the poorest in the country - the department\u2019s multidimensional poverty index is 80% higher than national average. Smallholder producers participate in environmentally unfriendly slash-and-burn activities, unsustainable cattle raising, short-cycle less profitable crops and/or illegal activities. \r\n\r\nThis initiative will regenerate the depleted soil in the region to support the production of subsistence crops and generate a flow of revenue through the production of cashew.",

Within only one year, Plant-for-the-Planet succeeded in making the area a vital carbon sink once again.\r\nToday, 100 workers are planting, on average, 5,500 seedlings per day. They are placing and caring for eight different native tree species and achieve a 94% survival rate, which is more than four times higher than other restoration projects in the region (around 20%).  Approximately 1100 trees grow per hectare. It's possible for Plant-for-the-Planet to plant and care for one tree for one Euro.\r\nPlant-for-the-Planet plans to restore 100 million trees on the Yucat\u00e1n-Peninsula.",

In 25 countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa, we searched for best practice projects for sustainability \u2013 among which there were many award-winning organic, fair trade and educational initiatives (www.expedition-welt.de). LIMBUA was founded with the goal of combining the best parts of these projects and thereby contributing to creating a better world.\r\n\r\nLIMBUA Tree Nursery works together with 5000 organic smallholder farmers. They receive formations and advise on organic cultivation and there products are brought to the market by an innovative and fair supply chain. Through those principles, LIMBUA became one of the world leading producers for organic macadamia nuts. \r\n\r\nThe LIMBUA Tree Nursery supplies the farmers with high quality tree seedlings (manly macadamia) but also sells seedling to external farmers.

        "description":"20 Million Trees for Kenya\u2019s Forests aims to celebrate the Centenary of ITF in 2024. ITF started life in Kenya when Richard St Barbe Baker and Chief Josiah Njonjo formed \u2018Watu wa Miti\u2019 \u2013 the Tree People. This became the society of the Men of the Trees, a worldwide organisation that promoted forest conservation and tree planting on a huge scale. \r\nHuge areas of Kenya\u2019s vital forests were lost in the 20th century: felled for timber, converted to farmland or industrial plantations, or slowly destroyed by livestock grazing, charcoal burning and over exploitation. Yet Kenya\u2019s rapid economic growth depends on its \u2018Water Tower\u2019 Forests. 80% of Kenya is arid or semi-arid and the country as a whole is very water scarce.  Rain-fed agriculture is the mainstay of people\u2019s livelihoods, and towns and industries rely on water for sustenance and for hydro-electric power.  \r\nThe project works with local community groups to restore degraded forest lands, increase tree cover on farmland around forests, and engage the next generation of tree planters in environmental stewardship. \r\nWe believe that true forest conservation works best when communities are engaged and see the benefits of this work. In fact, 20 Million Trees for Kenya\u2019s Forests is as much about the people as it is the trees. \r\nThe 20 Million Trees Campaign has three pillars.  \r\nFirstly forest restoration in degraded areas of Kenya\u2019s vital forest.  Tree seedlings of local indigenous species are raised by women groups and self-help groups.  In some cases farmers clear invasive weeds and cultivate crops within the forest while planning the trees.  In this way they protect both their crops and the trees until the canopy closes.\r\nSecondly we support community groups to increase the planting of trees on farms around the forests in agroforestry systems. Agroforestry is the incorporation of trees into farming systems, which increases the overall productivity, resilience and sustainability of farming and provides a wide range of products and services. These include enhanced soil fertility and organic matter, shade and shelter from wind, cooler and more humid micro-climates, improved crop yields, fodder, fruits, firewood and timber. Through having trees on farm, women and children spend less time having to go to the forest to collect firewood and fodder and take pressure off the forest.\r\nThirdly our projects involve school children and teachers in tree planting around their primary schools.  This has great practical benefits, sheltering the schools from wind and providing shade for the children as well as a sustainable supply of firewood from pruned branches. More importantly the children enjoy learning about the importance of trees and getting involved practically, so that they will be future tree planters.\r\n20 Million Trees for Kenya\u2019s Forests is restoring important, degraded forests across Kenya. It is also supporting local livelihoods. The community tree nurseries are small economic enterprises. Farmers gain increased income through tree nursery activities, agroforestry and in some case by growing crops around the young trees. Women groups use their income in their own Savings and Loans schemes, supporting members during times of trouble and enabling others to invest in small business enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe International Tree Foundation is tax deductible in the UK.",

This is a collective of over 1000 women, on the lower slopes of Uganda\u2019s Rwenzori Mountains, the UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is a very unique and fragile area that is being damaged due to deforestation. This project aims to:\r\n      -\tPlant 100,000 agroforestry trees on community-owned land.\r\n      -\tTrain local women in good farming practices, such as mango-grafting, and give them money-making opportunities from selling the fruits and forest products.\r\n      -\tImprove the food security and poverty levels of the local area.\r\n      -\tDivert resource demand away from the natural forests of the mountains to trees planted on community land.\r\n\r\nvisit: https://internationaltreefoundation.org/sustainable-community-forestry/",

To achieve this, we initiated a programme called \u201cTree the Solution\u201d The idea is to provide 500,000 tree/fruit seedlings which will be planted and fostered by the communities and schools especially area experiencing the brunt of the climate crisis like flood, erosion, water shortage, herder/farmer clashes and desertification. \r\nThe goal will be achieved through the implementation of the following objectives:\r\n(i) To sensitise the farming community about the linkages between food security and climate change.\r\n(ii) To promote adoption of climate smart farming practices (regenerative agroforestry). \r\n(iii) To ensure availability of seedlings in commercial quantities for farmers.\r\n(iv) Creation and maintenance of jobs, improvement in average income for families with low incomes especially women and young people.\r\n(v) To take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, end poverty in all its forms, achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss.\r\n\r\nAerobic Farms Limited is not tax deductible and can not issue donation receipts!",

The city is the second municipality with the highest deforestation rate in the state and the eighth in Brazil, mainly due to the ever-expanding livestock production, where vast areas of forest are destroyed and transformed into environmentally and socially unsustainable pastures.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the deforestation pressure, our project promotes the intercropping of coffee trees as the agricultural species and forest species of economic and food interest. Plantations that were previously planted with coffee monoculture are combined with indigenous trees such as ip\u00ea, andiroba, jatob\u00e1, among others, and are gradually transforming the landscape of the municipality. \r\n\r\nThe Apu\u00ed Agroforestry project has contributed to the reforestation of 33 hectares of land in the Amazonas State and increased productivity and diversification of products from local producers. The intercropping of coffee plants with native forest provides shading for the coffee plantations, which reduces exposure from the region\u2019s intense sunshine and changes the local microclimate. These conditions help to retain moisture and to gradually build the fertility of the soil which also help to enrich the quality of the coffee and increase its productivity. Besides, native species can also be exploited economically due to the value of their products.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of approach, the planting of trees is not only restoring degraded areas, but also providing an economical alternative for local producers, who can increase their income generation while also being involved with the forest conservation. \r\n\r\nIdesam is not tax deductible and cannot issue donation receipts!",

        "description":"Working with schools in Kitui County in Kenya, we engage students and teachers in learning about the environmental benefits of planting trees. The project also demonstrates best practice in tree planting, and supports parents to plant trees on their own land. The main species planted is an indigenous, fast growing and drought resistant tree called \u2018Melia Volkensii\u2019. This tree has many uses, including edible leaves used as fodder for animals, pruning branches for firewood, and as forage for bees. It can be easily integrated into crops through agroforestry farming systems. We are also planting indigenous species to provide shade, fruits and other products. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to work with up to 20 schools to plant areas of their grounds with plantations of around 1 acre. Farming communities will also be engaged, planting trees on their land.",

We are working with local organizations to identify areas that are best suited to post-fire reforestation. Our projects focus on creating habitat for endangered wildlife, restoring soil health in degraded agricultural landscapes, and helping the native ecosystem recover after unprecedented bushfires.\r\nWhile trees for this project will not go in the ground until the fire season has finished and the soil is ready for plantation, your support will help make sure we\u2019re ready to hit the ground running and repair the country\u2019s beautiful and iconic landscape once planting season hits. We\u2019re expecting to have the ability to contribute to the restoration of over 6 million trees across the country in 2020-21, thanks to our generous donors\u2019 ongoing support.",

The seedlings in the nursery include Warburgia ugandensis, Zanthoxylium gilletii, Albizia coriaria, Prunus africana and Grevillea robusta.\r\nMuch of the time was spent preparing the nursery maintaining the seedlings and training the farmers in the field skills of managing the seedlings the farm. The previous rains helped us to successfully raise the seedlings and by now we have enough to supply to 15 farmers (see photo 1 of the seedlings in the nursery).\r\nOur aim is that a total of 150 farmers, 50 at each of the projects that form the Kasese Network, will each plant 100 trees.

        "description":"Purchased with funds of a private endowment the area of 1,1000 square meters offers space for around 1,2 million trees.\r\nThe area degraded by deforestation, which Plant-for-the-Planet has acquired for the purpose of reforestation, encloses a natural lagoon with high biodiversity. This lagoon extends into a forest area that has already been reforested. Thus, this extension also protects the lagoon permanently from external disturbances.\r\nIt is planned to start planting at the beginning of rainy season in June 2020.\r\n\r\nSince 2015 Plant-for-the-Planet acquires areas degraded by deforestation in the state of Campeche on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in order to preserve them permanently for the forest stand through reforestation. This project is monitored by the National Forestry Commission of Mexico, @CONAFOR. The @CrowtherLab at ETH Z\u00fcrich accompanies the plantations with scientific research and advice.\r\nOnly typical regional tree species, such as Maculis, Balch\u00e9, Caoba and Ramon, are planted which are mixed within the individual areas to be equivalent to the local natural forest. The planting activities only take place during rainy season. Therefore the seedlings, which are cultivated in an own tree nursery, grow very well. Thanks to constant care during the first years of growth, Plant-for-the-Planet achieves an above average growth rate of 94%.\r\nThe reforestation on Yucat\u00e1n is a practical development of the Plant-for-the-Planet concept. The children and youth initiative is committing to planting trees as an effective means of combating the climate crisis. The key factor here is the simple implementation and efficient effect for absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. Since 2015, Plant-for-the-Planet has been planting the donated trees on the foundation's own land in Mexico, because trees grow particularly fast in the global south and thus filter many times more CO2 from the atmosphere than in Europe, for example.\r\nWith Plant-for-the-Planet as employer, this reforestation project also creates new jobs for the local population and thus provides social security for the families of the well over 100 permanent employees. \r\n\r\nWould you like to learn more about the PlanBe Foundation?

Foundation (EGIPF) has been supporting indigenous cultural communities (ICC) in the hinterlands of Davao City with forest protection, reforestation and agroforestry within their Ancestral Domains. The ICC shall be empowered to manage their Ancestral Domain in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way protecting the environment and the Ancestral rainforest with its biodiversity while sustaining their livelihood with agroforestry products like fruit trees, banana, abaca, coffee and cacao. As of now, around 18.000 forest and fruit trees have been planted on 30 has (with around 625 trees per ha) by the tribal farmers of the ICC in Sitio Macatabo, Barangay Carmen, Baguio District, Davao City. Presently, the farmers go on collecting seeds and wildlings, raise them in the project nursery or on their own and continue planting or sell them to EGIPF or other reforestation projects. EGIPF was asked by the elders of the Obu-Manuvu tribe to continue this successful approach and plant around 2,000 forest and fruit trees on 3 has together with the communities of Licuyan, Ladi-an and Patag in Baguio and Marilog District, Davao City until the end of 2020.\nThe overall goal will be to reforest around 15.000 has (i.e. around 10 Mio. trees) together with the 15 Indigenous Communities of the Obu-Manuvu Ancestral Domain. The more donations will come in, the faster we can achieve this goal. Hence this request for donations! \u2026 and every donor gets his/her own name plate!",

        "description":"The Konso are a tribe in South-West Ethiopia. Their lifestyle and the agroforestry that they have practiced for centuries, with its impressive terraced fields, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They can plant, cultivate and refine trees like no other group in Ethiopia and are role-models and experts for rural community-led forestry management. The Konso people depend on agroforestry and they need the ecosystem services of forested land to survive in a semi-arid environment.\r\nWith the existing five nurseries KDA would have the capabilities to supply more than a million seedlings per year. These can be planted on lands held by a cooperative of young people (with a 99 year lease). Furthermore, this youth group can acquire and develop the expertise through training with the Konso Development Association (KDA). The youth groups will be encouraged to start own multipurpose tree nurseries to maintain their plantation and to start a nursery business for additional income generation.\r\nThe Konso Development Association (KDA) is a non-political, non-religious and non-profit making local NGO (Non-Governmental Organization). KDA was founded in 1993 as a response to the natural and socio-economic problems at the root of the region\u2019s pervasive poverty. KDA is a community-based development organization that facilitates work to sustainably improve the living conditions of the people in the region.\r\nThe Konso Development Association (KDA) is a partner of Plant-for-the-Planet. As part of the pioneer collaboration project \u201cPlant-for-Ethiopia\u201d, since 2019 they are working together to develop a sustainable forestry management system as well as a vocational training programme for youth.\r\n\r\nvisit: https://konsoda.weebly.com for details\r\n\r\nKDA is not tax deductible and cannot issue donation receipts!",

Restoring the forest is extremely vital to safeguard the remaining biodiversity and combat the progressive loss of the world\u2019s species and for our climate as well. The high carbon sequestration potential of second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics means the Atlantic Forest is a key player in the climate change agenda. A partnership with Instituto de Pesquisas Ecol\u00f3gicas (IP\u00ca), the project aims to create forest corridors between remaining fragments, increasing tree cover and habitat connectivity for native species. The community-based nurseries, seed collection and planting activities are under the management of local people who, thanks to our project, are empowered to earn a living while restoring the forest.\r\n\r\nWeForest is tax deductible in the Netherlands!

        "description":"This project is about restoration and sustainable management of the Niger Delta mangroves using a community based mangrove management approach. The Niger Delta is located in the Atlantic coast of Southern Nigeria. The site falls under the Niger Delta wetlands region of Nigeria, Considered a global biodiversity hotspot. Mangroves constitute important nurseries for fishes, crustaceans, sponges, algae and other invertebrates, and also acts as a sink, retaining pollutants from contaminated tidal water. Mangroves are also used as shelter and breeding grounds by small mammals, shore birds, reptiles, and insects. The Niger Delta mangrove together with the creeks and rivers are a major source of food and livelihood for about 30 million people, which represents more than 17% of Nigeria's population. Other ecosystem services provided by this unique environment are flood control, ground water re-fill, reservoir of biodiversity, fuel wood, cultural values etc. This ecosystem also plays important role in climate change mitigation because of its high blue carbon sequestration potential. This is particularly important because of continuous gas flaring in Niger Delta from petroleum operations, which releases carbon dioxide among other gases into the atmosphere. This wetland is potentially a good site for ecotourism and also qualifies to be a world heritage site and Ramsar. Unfortunately, this unique ecosystem is on the decline and at the verge of been totally lost. The benefits derivable from this fragile ecosystem (mangroves) are under severe threat by anthropogenic stressors: deforestation, bush burning, logging, and urbanization. Mangrove forests are converted to farmlands and the trees are cut for timber, fuel, house construction and so on. Consequently, many coastal communities in the Niger Delta are losing their lives and primary livelihoods due to increased vulnerability to floods as a result of the disappearance of mangroves which usually serve as defense in times of coastal flooding. They are also now exposed to the high intensity of sunlight and heat waves as the land lay bare of trees to regulate sun rays. Therefore, there is urgent need to conserve the mangroves of the Niger Delta region, taking into consideration community livelihood perspective. The project aims at restoring and ensuring sustainable use of Niger Delta mangroves, thereby preventing further degraded of this critically wetlands. It will take place in Akwa Ibom state (the southern part of the Niger Delta Mangrove Belt), piloting mangrove conservation in Five communities along the mangrove belt facing high rate of mangrove depletion. It is expected to restore over 2000 hectares of mangroves with about 100,000 mangroves planted  Project activities will include: Awareness creation/sensitization; capacity building among the locals on mangrove management; mangrove re- planting; creation of mangrove reserves.The project phase is expected to last for a period of  three years and has ensured a strong collaboration/networking with relevant institutions/organizations within the region: State Ministry of Environment;Department of Forestry; Local Forestry/Environmental units, NGOs/CBOs etc. For some years now, the implementer (Tropical Research and Conservation Centre) in collaboration with other organizations has been working in some communities within the region to promote sustaining use of the mangroves.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project are:\r\n- Increase awareness on importance/conservation needs of mangrove forest \r\n- Establish a long term mangrove management/sustainable use plan engaging the local as pioneers in the management.\r\n- Restore the degraded mangroves and establish mangrove reserves using community participatory approach.\r\n\r\nThe project is in line with the \u201cPoverty Reduction Strategy\u201d which supports improving local resource management as a key element of poverty reduction. It  is  also  in line with the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) ratified in Nigeria in 1994 ; the  African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources; the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Protection in the Western Hemisphere; Agenda 21; the RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. \r\n\r\nIt is also consistent with aims and objectives of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) which are:\r\n- Improve methods and technologies that support the sustainable use of biological resources and eliminate or minimize adverse impacts on biodiversity resulting from resource use; \r\n- Promote sustainable use of biological resources and ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits for poverty reduction; \r\n- Reduce the adverse impacts of land use practices on forest, watersheds, soils, other ecosystems and species; \r\n- Enhance biodiversity management capability through education and awareness, appropriate formulation of policy and legislation, research and international cooperation. \r\n\r\nIt is also in line with UNIDO and Niger Delta Biodiversity Bio-diversity Programme recommendations for mangrove conservation within the region. \r\nExpected outcomes: \r\n- Increased local capacity in mangrove restoration and sustainable use.\r\n- Degraded mangrove sites restored and sustainable managed; ensuring protective habitat for many coastal species. \r\n- Remarkable (70%) reduction in commercial harvesting of timber/fire wood as a result of introduction of livelihoods alternative among key mangrove dependents (in bee/snail farming).\r\n- Increased in number of juvenile crabs, fish, shrimps, snails, periwinkles, turtles etc as their habitat (mangrove) is improved for their survival, thus protecting and sustaining an important food source for coastal communities. \r\n- Reduced coastal erosion/flood; Mangrove vegetation helps in protecting coastlines against wave damage during storms.\r\n\r\nRole of mangroves towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals:\r\nRestoring and protecting mangroves helps fulfil multiple Global Goals, from improving life below water, to reducing poverty and hunger, to many goals in between. The importance of restoring and protecting mangroves is reflected most clearly in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, which focuses on sustainably governing our oceans and coasts and recognises mangroves\u2019 immense value to local communities. But restoring mangrove forests also supports the achievement of many other SDGs, including eliminating poverty and hunger (SDG 1 and SDG 2), ensuring livelihoods and economic growth (SDG 8), taking actions against climate change impacts (SDG 13) and halting biodiversity loss (SDG 15). The reasons are 1. Mangrove forests are productive and species-rich hubs for marine life.\r\nRestoring mangroves means regaining extremely productive ecosystems that provide breeding and nursery grounds and ideal habitats for a variety of plant and animal species Poor and vulnerable populations can especially benefit from these readily available sources 2. Diverse opportunities from mangroves can offer sustainable income.\r\nThe sustainable harvest of mangrove products for market sales can create valuable business for local communities and small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers (2.3). Moreover, local income opportunities can be created through the creation of management and planning jobs involved in restoration projects (8.5).\r\n3. Mangrove forests are carbon-rich protective buffer zones between land and sea.\r\nRestoring mangrove forests directly targets goals related to climate adaptation and mitigation. Mangrove belts of sufficient width act as storm barriers that strengthen the resilience of coastal zones from climate-related hazards such as storm surges and sea-level rise and control coastal erosion (13.1).\r\nMangrove restoration sites can also be strategically placed to contribute to upgrading infrastructure with greater adoption of environmentally sound technologies (9.4) through applying \u2018green-grey infrastructures\u2019 for coastal protection. These actions build the resilience of vulnerable coastal communities by reducing their exposure to climate-related extreme events and environmental shocks and disasters (1.5).",

The first riverbank plantation capacity with around 130 hectares will be mapped out with 85000 trees. This first project will be a visible demonstration example for the whole Ashanti Region.  \r\n\r\nThis program will compensate climate-damaging carbon and combine the afforestation directly in the habitat of the population without consuming usable areas for agriculture and lifespace. Moreover this trees will counteract effects of soil erosion, river flooding, and air pollution. Along the Atwima rivers 85000 new planted trees will immediately improve lives of the local people and support at the same time the global fight against climate change.",

Unfortunately there is an extreme level of threat in the form of historical land clearing for agriculture and ongoing land degradation. Land degradation impacts biodiversity, landscape functionality and ultimately, food production in Western Australia. It has also caused disastrous impacts on the Aboriginal Noongar community. This community was once removed from country, breaking a 65,000+ years of cultural identity and cultural connection to country which supplied food, shelter, clothing and medicines. \r\n\r\nThrough this project, you are supporting the people of the Noongar community that have become active land managers. Commonland works in partnership with the Noongar land managers and Greening Australia. In 2008, the first plantings included Sandalwood, host species and biodiverse planting (to stabilize extreme erosion) on 170 hectares. From 2014 to 2018, biodiverse restoration took place on 300 hectares. In 2020, there is potential to plant 160.000 trees! Help us achieve this goal and restore country in Western Australia.",

Schools have up to 10 acres of land, and are motivated to plant trees to provide a sustainable source of firewood and timber. This helps reduce pressure on the indigenous forest which surround Mount Kenya - Africa's second highest mountain. The trees also improve biodiversity and provide shade in the playground when they are growing. Children engage in learning about the importance of trees, and the woodlots also act as demonstration sites to inspire parents to plant trees on their own land. We work with schools who are motivated to care for the trees on their land over the period of growth, which means we have excellent survival rates and can cut costs associated with fencing. We have run successful schools projects since 2016, and hope to expand this work over the coming years to support many more communities.",

        "description":"The Caribbean Tree Planting Project (CTPP) aims to plant one (1) million trees across at least ten (10) countries/territories in the Caribbean between January 2020 and June 2021. Through international, regional and national collaboration, the CTPP will not only ensure that trees are planted, but will also encourage public engagement in other activities centered around climate action. Components of the project will include encouraging farmers to engage in climate-smart agriculture and commissioning campaigns targeted towards the general public and behavioural change into making more climate-conscious decisions. \r\nThe project is a youth-led initiative to mobilize partnerships across the private, public, and philanthropic sectors in order to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. More specifically, activities will address SDGs 13 - Climate Action & 15 - Life on Land. The three (3) core objectives of the project are:\r\n1.\tTo plant at least one (1) million trees and engage the general public in related climate actions across at least 10 Caribbean countries;\r\n2.\tPromote Caribbean Youth and Caribbean Diaspora activism around climate change;\r\n3.\tHighlight the significance of multi-stakeholder partnerships and collaborative actions, especially among philanthropists, required to accelerate achievement of SDGs.\r\nThe CTPP is coordinated by the Caribbean Philanthropic Alliance in collaboration with several individuals and organizations including the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), the Trees That Feed Foundation (TTF), Jamaica Diaspora Taskforce Action Network (JDTAN), Jamaica Institute of Environmental Professionals (JIEP), International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Caribbean Girls Hack, Media Institute of the Caribbean, CARICOM Youth Ambassadors, Sandals Foundation, Grace Kennedy Foundation and LASCO Chin Foundation. \r\nWith the latest collaboration of the Smallholder Farmers Alliance, together with Timberland and other sponsors, and their commitment to plant 25 million trees in Haiti over five (5) years, it is expected that the CTPP will exceed its projected one (1) million target by 2021.",

        "description":"The Taita hills are the northernmost end of the Eastern Arc, a chain of ancient mountains running from S.E Kenya to S Tanzania. The Hills have a unique, highly threatened forest biota and are the highest-ranking conservation priority in Kenya. Deforestation is estimated at 98% and currently, only 12 highly fragmented forests remain with a combined total area of 500Ha only. The extreme levels of habitat loss, reduced forest connectivity and high levels of forest disturbance are causing severe threats to the Taita Hills' unique biodiversity.   \r\nSince 2014, in collaboration with other partners, we have focused our conservation efforts in protecting and restoring the cloud forest as well as enhancing ecological connectivity for these threatened endemic species. The science-driven multi-tactic approach involves Planting of indigenous tree species on degraded public land, eradication of invasive/exotic species and replacing with indigenous species, Land purchase on critical sites to protect species and connect habitats, policy and advocacy, Awareness and conducting research that guide on proper conservation approach.\r\nWith full involvement of the local community and the local government, we have identified 32 patches of degraded public land (c.380Ha) that range from 3-20ha and well distributed within the Taita Hills which form our target restoration areas. Through our restoration pilot project, we have formulated a practical approach that will see virtually all the identified 32 patches restored with natural vegetation in a span of 18 years. We are currently  restoring 20 hectares located in 3 strategic sites. \r\nIf the restoration of all the targeted sites is achieved together with the targeted land purchase, we shall achieve a 100% increase of the existing natural forest. this will significantly increase habitats and highly enhance forest connectivity thus solving the conservation puzzle of threatened species of both flora and fauna. Our restoration work will also contribute towards everting climate change and in ensuring increased water supply that will benefit local communities among other benefits.",

Plant-for-the-Planet also offers this area to research institutions for field trials. Scientific projects dedicated to the reforestation of tropical forests and related topics are invited to apply. A first scientific study was already started in January by the @CrowtherLab at ETH Zurich. A further study for Imperial College London will follow in summer 2020 and build on this first study. \r\n\r\nLocated near a passable road, this area is very suitable for visits as well! Soon a visitor forest will lead you through the research area(s) and let you experience science \u201cfirsthand\u201d. Furthermore, a tree nursery and a visitor center are planned for this site.\r\nFor special requests please contact info@plant-for-the-planet.org.\r\n\r\nField experiment @CrowtherLab/ETH Z\u00fcrich, started in 01/2020.\r\n\r\nThe experiments described here below have the potential to inform reforestation efforts globally as a proof-of-concept for the efficacy and potential impact of soil microbiome restoration. Plant-for-the-Planet Yucatan Reforestation project will be the first to implement the strategy at scale. \r\n\r\nDescription Global forest ecosystems absorb and offset nearly 30 percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions storing carbon in living plant biomass and soil. By this they have the potential to offset approximately half of all accumulated human CO2 emissions, making global reforestation one of our most promising negative emissions technologies to date. Soil inoculation with native microbial communities increases seedling growth and survival as shown in greenhouse experiments as well as field trials in grassland ecosystems. However, to date, there is no reforestation field trial that actively manipulates the forest microbiome. As a result, whether or not we can restore the forest soil microbiome under realistic field conditions, and in turn improve forest restoration outcomes and C-sequestration rates, remains unknown.\r\nIn Yucat\u00e1n we have created a field experiment to directly test the impact of soil microbiome restoration on tree growth, survival and ecosystem carbon sequestration rates.\r\nWe planted native tree species mixes with and without soil microbiome inoculation (the complex community of soil bacteria and fungi) from multiple environments. We measure tree growth, survival and carbon sequestration. By comparing inoculated and un-inoculated treatments we will be able to directly measure the impact of soil microbiome on restoration outcomes. We will test the efficacy of soil microbiome restoration for improving forest restoration outcomes and carbon sequestration rates. \r\n\r\nExperimental Design \r\nImplemented within a randomised block design we applied 17 treatments across 10 experimental blocks. Each experimental plot is 900 m2 in area, for a total experimental area of 15.8 hectares. 100 trees were planted in each subplot (except for the natural regeneration control plot). 16,000 trees were planted across the entire experiment. The experimental site was a cattle ranch right up to the onset of planting. In inoculation plots, 500 ml of soil were added to each planting hole. The soil was sourced from a ca 30 year old nearby forest (18.524040, -89.748748) of the same soil type at up to 20 cm depth. \r\n\r\nMeasuring outcomes\r\n- soil properties (%C, %N, texture, pH, micronutrients) before and after planting, at 2 and 5 years. \r\n- soil microbiome immediately at planting, 6 months later and then annually for ten years.\r\n- tree diameter growth, height and survival rates annually. \r\n- foliar chemistry, wood density annually. \r\n- leaf level physiology during growing season. \r\n- root properties of saplings going out (which mycorrhizas are present on roots). \r\n- Re-measure root mycorrhizas when re-sampling.",

The project aims to address some of these issues. The tiger forms a very important part of both the ecology and economy of the Sundarbans, providing great economic returns. D. Balasubramanian mentions in his writing, the various functions of a tiger reserve that contributes to ecology, the economy as well as culture and planting the trees contribute to the habitat conservation of the tiger thus contributing to the tiger and other wildlife conservation in the long run. (Balasubramanian, 2017).\r\nThus, the plantation of mangroves around villages at the Periphery of the Sundarbans National Park directly impacts rural livelihoods by creating jobs in nursery and planting activities, improve fisheries catch, provide flowers, fruit, fodder and fuel to rural communities and wildlife, generate oxygen, reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, fight climate change, and benefit endemic wildlife including the endangered Tiger. Reforestation thus provides ample livelihood opportunities for the people in the buffer area, preventing them from venturing into the forest and minimising chances of conflict and empowerment of the dwellers as a result.",
